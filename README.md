# potato-mod
PotatoMod is a mod for RetroStudio that uses exploits to achieve things that normally aren't possible in the studio. Some of these things are QOL (Quality Of Life) features, like dark mode, clear console, and more. There is nothing abusive about potato-mod, as it gives no in-game advantage. PotatoMod is currently in development, but prerelease builds may come soon!
