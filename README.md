# potato-mod
PotatoMod is a mod for RetroStudio  ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶s̶ ̶e̶x̶p̶l̶o̶i̶t̶s̶  to achieve things that normally aren't possible in the studio. Some of these things are QOL (Quality Of Life) features, like dark mode, clear console, and more. There is nothing abusive about potato-mod, as it gives no in-game advantage. PotatoMod is currently in development, but prerelease builds may come soon!

In older versions of PotatoMod, you needed to use exploits, this is no longer true as the developer Cristiano added it into the base game! 
You can load PotatoMod by inserting the model code "PotatoMod"
